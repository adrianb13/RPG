This is a game app I created using a Star Wars Theme.

You are able to pick 1 of 4 characters(Jedi/Sith).  You must defeat all other fighters to be crowned the best fighter in the Universe.

Each fighter has a set Attack power and Counter-Attack power along with their Health Points (HP) Level.  With each click, you attack will strengthen but the opponent will automatically deal a counter-attack.

Your fighter will keep it's attack experience with each battle.  But your HP does NOT regenerate with each new battle, so choose your opponents wisely.  Each fighter has the opportunity to be the best, but you have to choose the order of fighters correctly.
